## This week, I worked together with a team to build the game BoarDash.

The game is hosted here: https://boar-dash.vercel.app/
Here is the GitHub repository: https://github.com/isaacrestrick/BoarDash

I worked together with Hubert and Boris, here are their GitHub profiles:
- Boris: https://github.com/radx98
- Hubert: https://github.com/hleo1

Hubert led art direction, Boris handled combat, and I worked on game systems and integrated our work.

## What's the game about?

You are a BoarDasher, and you are picking up and delivering food to both villagers and the king. 
There are some skeletons which do not share your goals.
There is also a wizard who narrates your journey.

While completing your deliveries you gain various titles relating to your heroic deeds.
To successfully beat the game, deliver the needed meals to all villagers and deliver the king his burger(s).
To lose the game, the skeletons may get the best of you or you may fall off the right side of the map.

Possible future directions:
- Multiplayer
- More art
- More enemies
- Scores in a DB

## Techologies used

Frontend:
- Phaser, Vite, React, TypeScript

Backend:
- Frontend hosted on Vercel

## Learnings

Working on a fast-moving team greatly increased my comfort level with handling merge conflicts.
