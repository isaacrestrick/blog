summary: 'Chatbot, with memory'
---

## This week, I built a chatbot that leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5's ability to interact with a memories folder and use it as a memory store.

The site is hosted on here: https://chatbot-five-chi-87.vercel.app/
Here is the github repository: https://github.com/isaacrestrick/chatbot

The site has the following features:
- Users can sign up and log in with either an email or a google account
- Users can create new chats, view old chats, or delete old chats
- Each user's account has an associated memories folder in a supabase bucket, which claude reads and write to through a memory tool

Future directions:
- Name chats
- More than one set of memories - a user could have multiple projects as opposed to Claude having one memory
- Adding the ability for users to view and edit these files as well
- Make the experience like that of a coding agent, but for a respository of generic text files as opposed to a code repository
- Clean up code

## Technologies used

Frontend:
- React Router (framework), Vercel AI SDK, BetterAuth
- Shadcn, Assistant UI

Backend:
- React Router (framework), Vercel AI SDK
- Supabase Database and Supabase Storage

## Learnings

I am gaining familiarity with building full-stack applications.
